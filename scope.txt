1. 5, global variable num is initialized to 5 and the function prints it

2. 5, global variable num is initialized to 5, the function 
initializes its own local variable to 10, the function call
doesn't return or print anything and the prins statement prints the global variable 5

3. 10, global variable num is initialized to 5, the function 
the function my_func references the global variable num and sets
it to 10, the function call executes the code that sets num to 
10 and then the print statement prints num which is 10

4. Hello World, the outer function has outer_var which is 
initialized to 'Hello', the inner function has a inner_var initialized
to 'World' and a print statement that prints the outer_var and
the inner_var, the function call of inner() is in ther outer 
function and the function call of outer() executes that code:
first initializing outer_var='Hello' then defining the inner 
function which initializes innter_var='World' the the print 
statement followed by a function call of inner()

5. won't print anything, raises a NameError, num is not defined
outside my_func

6. Inner 1: 25
   Inner 2: 15
inner_func1 has its own local variable x which is initialized to
25, inner_func2 references the variable x that is initialized to
15 in my_func
